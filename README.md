******DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT******
this project represent the first step to build the web application, the "AirBnb clone" where we will write a command interepter to manage our AirBnB project.
To pass this project we should use python as a programming language and the command interepter.
*****DESCRIPTION OF THE TASKS to understand*****
Each task is linked and will help to:

* put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
* create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
* create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
* create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage related to each element
* create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
